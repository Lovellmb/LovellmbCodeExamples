Rules- 
game is won when your opponent has no king pieces remaining
there is no 'check' or 'checkmate' 

BOMB TILES
    bomb tiles turn pawns and knights into bombers. 
    all other pieces disarm bomb tiles


Piece movements



PAWN - 
    moves like regular pawn after first move. During first move, it can move one space diagonally.
    pawns can promote to 'knights' (not normal chess knights) after taking 2 pieces
    pawns can promote to cavalry after taking a cavalry piece
    pawns can promote to Bombers by stepping on a bomb tile
    Pawns can promote to Super kings by reaching the other side of the board

KNIGHT -
    moves one tile in any direction
    knights can promote to a king after taking 2 pieces
    knights can promote to cavalry after taking a cavalry piece
    knights can promote to Super kings by reaching the other side of the board

KING - 
    moves 1 tile diagonally or 2 tiles in a cardinal direction
    kings can promote to Super kings by reaching the other side of the board
Bomber- 
    moves 1 space in any direction
    when a bomber is taken by any piece other than an archer, the attacking piece is also destroyed

NINJA-
    moves up to 3 spaces in any direction
    the only piece that can move through other pieces

ARCHER-
